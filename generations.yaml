    description: "The original Peugeot 308 was introduced as a replacement for the 307, featuring more conventional styling compared to its MPV-influenced predecessor, with a focus on improved quality and refinement. Available in multiple body styles including three and five-door hatchbacks, a station wagon (SW), and the 308 CC featuring a folding metal hardtop. The exterior design showcased a more sophisticated aesthetic with a prominent grille, flowing lines, and improved aerodynamics. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included gasoline engines ranging from 1.4L to 1.6L (the latter co-developed with BMW and featuring turbocharging in higher performance variants) and diesel options from 1.6L to 2.0L HDi, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The high-performance GTi variant featured a 1.6L turbocharged engine producing 200 horsepower. The interior represented a significant improvement in material quality and design compared to the 307, with a more driver-focused layout and improved ergonomics. A significant facelift in May 2011 brought updated styling including a smaller grille and revised front fascia more aligned with Peugeot's evolving design language, along with improved engines offering better efficiency and reduced emissions. A second facelift in 2015 was applied to South American markets where the EMP2 platform was not industrialized, featuring updated front bumper design inspired by the second-generation 308. While European production ended in 2013 when the second generation launched, first-generation 308 continued manufacture in Argentina until 2021, sold alongside the imported second-generation model locally named 308 S. The first-generation 308 successfully repositioned Peugeot's compact offering with a more premium feel and conventional styling, improving the brand's quality perception while maintaining competitive pricing in the European C-segment."

    description: "The second-generation Peugeot 308 marked a substantial leap forward in design, quality, and technology, built on PSA's new EMP2 platform offering reduced weight and improved efficiency. Unveiled in May 2013 and awarded the 2014 European Car of the Year, it was available as a five-door hatchback and station wagon (SW), featuring more sophisticated styling with a smaller, more upright grille, sleeker headlights, and a more athletic stance. The exterior design won praise for its elegant proportions and premium appearance. Powertrain options expanded to include improved PureTech gasoline engines (1.2L to 1.6L) and BlueHDi diesel options (1.5L to 2.0L), with the performance-oriented GTi by Peugeot Sport featuring a 1.6L turbocharged engine producing up to 270 horsepower with advanced features including an electronic limited-slip differential and Alcon brakes. The interior introduced Peugeot's innovative i-Cockpit design concept with a small steering wheel positioned below the instrument cluster, minimalist dashboard, and high-mounted controls centered around a touchscreen infotainment system—a design that proved polarizing but became a signature Peugeot element. A facelift in 2017 brought a new bonnet, front bumper design with scrolling indicators, updated grille featuring the new Peugeot Lion logo, and improved infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. An eight-speed automatic transmission replaced the previous six-speed unit. The 2020 update introduced the digital i-Cockpit first seen on the 3008. Production of the second-generation 308 ended in May 2021, successfully repositioning the model as a more upscale alternative to mainstream competitors like the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus."

    description: "The current Peugeot 308 represents another significant advancement, featuring bold, distinctive styling with an aggressive front end showcasing Peugeot's new lion-head logo, slimmer headlights, and the brand's signature 'fang' LED daytime running lights. Built on the third-generation EMP2 platform (EMP2 V3) with an increased wheelbase, it's available as a five-door hatchback and station wagon (SW). Unveiled in March 2021 and launched in May 2021, with production beginning September 29, 2021, it was the first vehicle to bear Peugeot's new logo. The design features a sleeker silhouette with reduced height and a drag coefficient of 0.28. Powertrain options diversified significantly to include traditional PureTech gasoline and BlueHDi diesel engines alongside new plug-in hybrid variants (308 Hybrid and Hybrid 180/225) combining a 1.6L gasoline engine with an electric motor for total system outputs of either 180 or 225 horsepower and approximately 60km of electric-only range under WLTP testing. A fully electric e-308 was introduced in September 2022 with a 54 kWh battery pack (80% nickel, 10% manganese, 10% cobalt) providing approximately 400km of range. The interior features Peugeot's evolved i-Cockpit concept with a 10-inch digital instrument display, 10-inch central touchscreen with customizable i-toggle shortcut buttons, and an overall more premium design with high-quality materials. Advanced technology includes semi-autonomous driving capabilities (Drive Assist pack with adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, and semi-automatic lane change), matrix LED headlights on GT and GT Premium variants, and enhanced connectivity features. The station wagon version was released in June 2021, while a crossover derivative (408) was unveiled in June 2022. A facelift in August 2025 brought design updates and improved EV range for the e-308. The third-generation 308 positions itself as a technology-forward, premium-feeling alternative in the compact segment."
