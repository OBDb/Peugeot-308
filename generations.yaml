    description: "The original Peugeot 308 was introduced as a replacement for the 307, featuring more conventional styling compared to its MPV-influenced predecessor, with a focus on improved quality and refinement. Available in multiple body styles including three and five-door hatchbacks, a station wagon (SW), and the 308 CC featuring a folding metal hardtop. The exterior design showcased a more sophisticated aesthetic with a prominent grille, flowing lines, and improved aerodynamics. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included gasoline engines ranging from 1.4L to 1.6L (the latter co-developed with BMW and featuring turbocharging in higher performance variants) and diesel options from 1.6L to 2.0L HDi, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The high-performance GTi variant featured a 1.6L turbocharged engine producing 200 horsepower. The interior represented a significant improvement in material quality and design compared to the 307, with a more driver-focused layout and improved ergonomics. A significant refresh in 2011 brought updated styling including a smaller grille and revised front fascia more aligned with Peugeot's evolving design language, along with improved engines offering better efficiency and reduced emissions. The first-generation 308 successfully repositioned Peugeot's compact offering with a more premium feel and conventional styling, improving the brand's quality perception while maintaining competitive pricing in the European C-segment."

    end_year: 2021
    description: "The second-generation Peugeot 308 marked a substantial leap forward in design, quality, and technology, built on PSA's new EMP2 platform offering reduced weight and improved efficiency. Available as a five-door hatchback and station wagon (SW), it featured more sophisticated styling with a smaller, more upright grille, sleeker headlights, and a more athletic stance. The exterior design won praise for its elegant proportions and premium appearance, helping it secure the European Car of the Year award for 2014. Powertrain options expanded to include improved PureTech gasoline engines (1.2L to 1.6L) and BlueHDi diesel options (1.5L to 2.0L), with the performance-oriented GTi featuring a 1.6L turbocharged engine producing up to 270 horsepower. The interior introduced Peugeot's innovative i-Cockpit design concept with a small steering wheel positioned below the instrument cluster, minimalist dashboard, and high-mounted controls centered around a touchscreen infotainment systemâ€”a design that proved polarizing but became a signature Peugeot element. Material quality improved substantially with soft-touch surfaces and premium trim options. A refresh in 2017 brought subtle styling updates, improved infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and an eight-speed automatic transmission option replacing the previous six-speed unit. The second-generation 308 successfully repositioned the model as a more upscale alternative to mainstream competitors like the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus, emphasizing French design flair, driving dynamics, and perceived quality over outright practicality."

    description: "The current Peugeot 308 represents another significant advancement, featuring bold, distinctive styling with an aggressive front end showcasing Peugeot's new lion-head logo, slimmer headlights, and the brand's signature 'fang' LED daytime running lights. Built on an updated version of the EMP2 platform, it's available as a five-door hatchback and station wagon (SW). Powertrain options diversified significantly to include traditional PureTech gasoline and BlueHDi diesel engines alongside new plug-in hybrid variants combining a 1.6L gasoline engine with an electric motor for total system outputs of either 180 or 225 horsepower and approximately 37 miles of electric-only range. A fully electric e-308 joined the lineup in 2023 with a 54 kWh battery providing around 250 miles of range. The interior features Peugeot's evolved i-Cockpit concept with a 10-inch digital instrument display, 10-inch central touchscreen with customizable i-toggle shortcut buttons, and an overall more premium design with high-quality materials. Advanced technology includes semi-autonomous driving capabilities, matrix LED headlights on higher trims, and enhanced connectivity features. The third-generation 308 positions itself as a technology-forward, premium-feeling alternative in the compact segment, with particular emphasis on electrified powertrain options and distinctive design elements that differentiate it from more conventional competitors. The high-performance variant shifted from the GTi badging to the Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) sub-brand, though as of initial production, a 308 PSE model has yet to be introduced."
